Repository Name: Internship Projects of CipherByte Technologies by Sreemoyee

Description:
Welcome to my GitHub  CBTCIP repository, which showcases my internship projects. This repository contains two engaging and functional Python applications:

ðŸŽ® Rock Paper Scissors Game: A classic two-player game implemented with a user-friendly interface using Python's Tkinter library. Players can input their names, make their choices, and see the winner announced on the screen.

ðŸ§¾ Payment Receipt Application: A practical application built with Python's ReportLab library to generate stylish PDF payment receipts. Users can input their details, and the application generates a well-formatted receipt with customized fonts and backgrounds.

These projects demonstrate my proficiency in Python programming, user interface design, and generating dynamic content. 
They are designed to be simple, intuitive, and easily extendable for future enhancements.
